### Create IDrive account

Sign up for an IDrive monthly plan.

Use a default encryption key.

When I click to download the client, it downloads a Windows executable.

A Linux or Ubuntu client is not clearly offered from the user interface.

See [Linux Backup via Scripts](https://www.idrive.com/linux-backup-scripts). This is mostly advertising for a Snowball-type physical data delivery.

See [Data Protection for your Linux machines using Scripts](https://www.idrive.com/readme), referred to as a Linux scripts README from the page above. This has all the technical documentation, but no download link.

Instead of a download link it says "Contact our support team for script package download link.".

### Request Download Link

Description:

```
Please share with me a download link for the Linux client/scripts.

On this page I see the technical documentation, but no download link.

https://www.idrive.com/readme

Instead it says "Contact our support team for script package download link."
```

I fill in all the same details in the contact form as those I just provided when creating my account.

I click "Report to Tech Support" and wait.

So far, I'm unimpressed.

An automatic email response:

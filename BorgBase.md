### Sign up

Sign up for BorgBase.

I already have a BorgBase login (created 2022-04-27!).

The account with my normal isn't active, and I didn't receive the activation mail or the password reset after 10 minutes, so I created a new account with `+borgbase` email syntax.

No payment details required for sign up. Good for low-risk testing.

### Add repository

BorgBase first run looks like this:

# Arana Ubuntu Desktop

I subscribed to the Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS - GUI Gnome with NICE DCV from Arana Solutions.

* AMI ID: ami-090bcad17dd840321
* Product Code: 1f48liip4hmaxzx9nhc3040a0

I try launching a t3.medium using the Marketplace launcher.

From the usage instructions for v1222:

* The user is `ubuntu`.
* The password is the instance ID.

## First run

The first run went as well as it did when I set it up by myself once.

Now I no longer have to set it up myself!
